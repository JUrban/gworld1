# Direct products of finitely generated soluble Hopfian groups

A Lean 4 formalisation of the affirmative answer to Kourovka Problem 5.38:
**the direct product of two finitely generated soluble Hopfian groups is Hopfian.**

## The formalised problem

A group is **Hopfian** if each of its surjective endomorphisms is injective.
The factors may have arbitrary centres, and endomorphisms of their ordinary
external direct product may mix the factors.

The definition `ProductHopficityStatement` in
[Problem.lean](Kourovka/Problem.lean) records finite generation, solubility and
Hopficity for each factor. The result is proved as
`directProduct_isHopfian` in [CentralHopfian.lean](Kourovka/CentralHopfian.lean):

```lean
theorem directProduct_isHopfian
    [Group.FG A] [Group.FG B] [IsSolvable A] [IsSolvable B]
    (hA : IsHopfian A) (hB : IsHopfian B) : IsHopfian (A × B)
```

The declaration `problem_5_38` in [Paper.lean](Kourovka/Paper.lean) assembles
this result with the exact problem definition. All declaration names below
are in the namespace `Kourovka`.

## Central products and a bound on nonabelian images

For a finitely generated abelian group $M$, define

```math
b(M)=\mathrm{rank}_{\mathbb{Z}}(M)+|\mathrm{Tor}(M)|-1.
```

Here the two terms are the rank and the order of the torsion subgroup.
This weight is positive for nonzero $M$ and satisfies

```math
b(M\oplus N)\ge b(M)+b(N).
```

[AbelianWeight.lean](Kourovka/AbelianWeight.lean) proves these properties.
For a finitely generated group $H$, set

```math
w(H)=b\bigl((H/Z(H))_{\mathrm{ab}}\bigr).
```

[SolvableWeight.lean](Kourovka/SolvableWeight.lean) and
[CenterWeight.lean](Kourovka/CenterWeight.lean) show that $w(H)>0$ whenever
$H$ is soluble and nonabelian.

If $H=PQ$ for commuting subgroups $P,Q$, then
`CentralProducts.quotientEquiv` in
[CentralProducts.lean](Kourovka/CentralProducts.lean) constructs

```math
H/Z(H)\cong P/Z(P)\times Q/Z(Q).
```

When $P,Q$ are finitely generated, `CenterWeight.split` deduces
$w(P)+w(Q)\le w(H)$. This bounds the number of nonabelian images in each
level of the component-path construction.

## Component paths and mixed iterates

Let $f$ be a surjective endomorphism of $G=A\times B$, and let $e_0,e_1$
be the coordinate projections regarded as endomorphisms of $G$.
For a binary word $v=i_0\cdots i_{n-1}$, define

```math
p_v=e_{i_0}f\cdots e_{i_{n-1}}f,\qquad P_v=p_v(G).
```

The maps are composed from right to left. At each fixed length, their images
commute pairwise and generate $G$. Moreover, $P_v=P_{v0}P_{v1}$ with commuting
children. These identities are proved in [Paths.lean](Kourovka/Paths.lean)
and [PathExpansion.lean](Kourovka/PathExpansion.lean).

For finitely generated soluble factors, at most $W=w(G)$ infinite binary
paths have nonabelian images at every level. On any finite set of at most
$W$ elements, every endomorphism $s$ satisfies $s^{2W!}=s^{W!}$.
`FinitePaths.factorial_iterate_idempotent` in
[FinitePaths.lean](Kourovka/FinitePaths.lean) proves this explicit bound.
Applying it to the shift gives one exponent

```math
m=W!,\qquad W=w(A\times B),\qquad 0!=1,
```

for every surjective endomorphism of the fixed product.
`ProductPaths.finitePath_factorial_middle_eq_terminal` in
[PathExtension.lean](Kourovka/PathExtension.lean) proves that every word
$v$ of length greater than $2m$ with nonabelian $P_v$ has $v_m=v_{2m}$,
using zero-based indices.

`ProductPaths.factorial_mixed_iterate_central` in
[MixedPaths.lean](Kourovka/MixedPaths.lean) applies this constraint to obtain

```math
f^m e_j f^m e_k(G)\le Z(G)\qquad(j\ne k).
```

## Eventual centrality of the off-diagonal components

`CenterQuotients.retract_trivial_of_killed` in
[CenterQuotients.lean](Kourovka/CenterQuotients.lean) proves that a soluble
retract of a finitely generated group is trivial if a surjective endomorphism
kills it. Its proof passes to abelianisation and uses the fact that a perfect
soluble group is trivial.

[EventualCentrality.lean](Kourovka/EventualCentrality.lean) applies this
retract argument modulo the centre. The resulting declaration
`central_offDiagonal_factorial_iterate` states that, for every surjective
endomorphism $f$ of a product of finitely generated soluble groups,
$F=f^m$ with the fixed exponent $m=w(A\times B)!$ satisfies

```math
F_{12}(B)\le Z(A),\qquad F_{21}(A)\le Z(B).
```

Here $F_{12}(b)$ is the first coordinate of $F(1,b)$, and $F_{21}(a)$ is
the second coordinate of $F(a,1)$. **This result does not assume that either
factor is Hopfian.**

Under the natural identification

```math
(A\times B)/Z(A\times B)\cong A/Z(A)\times B/Z(B),
```

the endomorphism induced by $f^{w(A\times B)!}$ is a product of surjective
endomorphisms of $A/Z(A)$ and $B/Z(B)$.
`central_offDiagonal_iff_quotient_product` in
[QuotientProducts.lean](Kourovka/QuotientProducts.lean) proves the equivalence
with central off-diagonal images, and `factorial_quotient_product` applies
it to the uniform exponent.

## Integral lifts and central corrections

[CentralLattice.lean](Kourovka/CentralLattice.lean) proves an integral
correction result. Fix a homomorphism $c:Z\to M$ of abelian groups, with
$M$ finitely generated. `CentralLattice.exists_uniform_correction_modulus`
produces an integer $d\ne0$ with the following property: if an endomorphism
$u$ preserves $c(Z)$, satisfies $u(M)+c(Z)=M$, and is the identity modulo
$dM$, then there is a homomorphism $h:M\to Z$ such that $u+c\circ h$ is
surjective. The proof uses saturation, an integral denominator and control
of torsion. No finite-generation assumption is imposed on $Z$.

`CentralLattice.exists_group_correction_modulus` transfers this construction
to a finitely generated group $G$. Assume an endomorphism $u$ preserves
$Z(G)$, satisfies $u(G)Z(G)=G$, is surjective on $G'$, and induces the
identity modulo the chosen integer on $G_{\mathrm{ab}}$. Then a
centre-valued homomorphism $h$ makes

```math
\widetilde{u}(x)=u(x)h(x)
```

surjective. The declaration `centralCorrection_eq_on_commutator` in
[Components.lean](Kourovka/Components.lean) proves that this correction agrees
with $u$ on $G'$. Then `centralCorrection_injective_on_derived` in
[DerivedReduction.lean](Kourovka/DerivedReduction.lean) deduces injectivity
of $u$ on $G'$ when $G$ is Hopfian.

## Injectivity and the product theorem

The declaration `injective_of_central_offDiagonal_hopfian` in
[CentralHopfian.lean](Kourovka/CentralHopfian.lean) proves that a surjective
endomorphism of $A\times B$ is injective if both off-diagonal images are
central and both factors are finitely generated and Hopfian.
**Solubility is not required for this injectivity criterion.**

The diagonal maps need not themselves be surjective. A common positive
iterate provides the congruences needed for central corrections, via
[CentralPeriod.lean](Kourovka/CentralPeriod.lean) and
[DiagonalCongruence.lean](Kourovka/DiagonalCongruence.lean).
Hopficity of the factors makes the corrected maps injective, hence the
diagonal maps are injective on the derived subgroups. Since the kernel of
the product endomorphism lies in $A'\times B'$, it is trivial.

Combining this criterion with eventual centrality proves
`directProduct_isHopfian`, and therefore `problem_5_38`.

## Build and verification

With Lean installed through elan, run

```sh
./scripts/check.sh
```

The package pins Lean and Mathlib to version 4.24.0 and has no dependency
on another Kourovka project. The script builds the library, runs the
transitive axiom audit in [Audit.lean](Audit.lean), and checks the exact
problem statement in [Completion.lean](Completion.lean). The only permitted
axioms are `propext`, `Classical.choice` and `Quot.sound`.
